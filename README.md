On the use of Ensembles for Weather Forecasting in Lugano.
The ensemble used represents the mean of results taken from 9 different forecast models. I perform an analysis on the uncertainties and skill scores of the Ensemble and single model forecasts by using
deterministic and probabilistic methods to show the improvements achieved by using a multi-model instead of a singlemodel ensemble. In order to understand the success of the multi-model approach a number of skill scores are employed to
compare the relative performance of the models when separate and when combined. A comparison has also been made to
how Climatology succeeded in predicting the weather by comparison to the observed data from the weather in Lugano in
December and January of 2020/2021
